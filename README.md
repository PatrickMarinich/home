A Personal Website using GitHubs Pages :)

# About
* This website is my first exposure to and main place of practice for HTML, JS, and CSS. 
* This site will be a place where I test some ideas things I have found online.
* Any code that is not mine will contain a comment in its respective file with either the dev name or a link, any files without this are my own
* The goal is to be able to experiment with HTML, JS, and CSS, and see what type of creative things I can come up with.
* As my skills in these languages develope this may turn into a place to showcase my professional skills, however I am still in the learning phase.
