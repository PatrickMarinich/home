    <dt>Handwritten Numbers AI</dt>
    <dd>The Handwritten Numbers AI code was written as My first ever intro to ML Model coding. The Model Size was inspired by the 3Blue1Brown video on the subject. 
      It uses the handwritten numbers from MINST and the goal of the Model was for it to determine what number was written within the image. By using a similar Neural
      Net size as that of the video, I was able to achieve a 98-99% accuracy rating</dd>
    
    <dt>Maleria Detector Model</dt>
    <dd>Written for a Big Th!nk AI competition at UMD, My partner and I experimented with different sized models with different activation functions, The size that we chose was the best that we could figure out within the alloted time frame and therefore many not be optimized. 
      To score accuracy we used a confusion matrix to differentate between true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
      An accuracy rating of 94% was able to get us second place in the winter 2021 semester competition. </dd>
